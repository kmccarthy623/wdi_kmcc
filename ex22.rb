# File.seek() - locate a particular spot in the file
# File.truncate() - used to remove the contents of a file
# File.write() - write line or characters to a file
# STDIN - used with methods when ARGV is used as well, to differentiate between the two
# [ ] - used to seprate arguments---an array
# \\ - escapes a backslash
# \n - newline character
# \t - inserts a tab
# chomp - used typically with gets. Removes the newline character from aline of text
