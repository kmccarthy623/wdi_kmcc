#Exercise seven 
#print out the string: Mary had a little lamb
puts "Mary had a little lamb."
#print out the string: Its fleece was white as the variable snow
puts "Its fleece was white as %s. " %'snow'
#print out the string:  And everwhere that Mary went. 
puts "And everywhere that Mary went."
#Prints out the string . 10 times 
puts "." * 10 #what'd that do? 

# Gives String values to end# variables 
end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

# notice how we are using print instead of puts here.chage it to puts 
# and see what happens. #EC-> puts and strings are the same, but print 
# printed this out as two lines.  Print seems to continue the string on the same line  

puts end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6 
puts end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12

#this just is polite use of the terminal, try removing it 
puts
 #removing it is fine- it just give a little more space as it returns an empty line


# extra credit
#1. Adding commets to each line
#2. writing down your errors---I didn't see any this time around..but I am sure i will have some soon!
